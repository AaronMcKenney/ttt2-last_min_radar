The Last Minute Radar will give all remaining players a radar once both of these conditions are met:
1. A certain amount of time has passed (5 minutes by default)
2. A certain number of players are left (3 by default)
 
This addon will assist the remaining players in their attempts to find each other, which may otherwise be difficult for large maps.
